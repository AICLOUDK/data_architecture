Data Structure and Architecture refers to two interconnected concepts in computer science:

Data Structure:

A way of organizing, storing, and managing data so that it can be efficiently accessed and modified.
Examples include arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, hash tables, graphs, etc.
The choice of data structure affects the performance of algorithms in terms of speed and memory usage.
Architecture:

The overall design and organization of a computer system or software application.
It includes how hardware components, software, and data structures interact.
Software architecture defines the high-level structure of software systems, including modules, components, and their relationships.
In summary:  

Data structure focuses on how data is stored and organized within a program.
Architecture refers to the broader design of the entire system, including how data structures fit into the overall structure to achieve efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.
